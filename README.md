We provide codes for a validation method of heterogeneous treatment effect (HTE) estimation. The validation procedure is based on the distance metric: proximity score distance, and the matching method: factmatch with an associated pruning algorithm. We also provide an example of using the validation method for tuning a LASSO based HTE estimator.
